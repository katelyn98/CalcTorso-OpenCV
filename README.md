# MachineLearning-ComputerVision

My projects can be found in PythonML and in another separate repository: JamDraw. 
These projects are done in Python and use the OpenCV library functions. Check them out!

The main project is this project is titled as 
### Using Live Object Tracking Techniques to Measure ThoracicRotation Range of Motion with Real-Time Results
and is going to be submitted to the Face and Gesture Analysis For Health Infomratics Workshops at ICMI 2020. 

Some images below show a proof of concept, but a video can be found under the research tab of my personal website.
